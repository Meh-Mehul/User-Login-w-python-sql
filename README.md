# User-Login-w-python-sql
using sqlite3 and python, this is a simple user login checker UI app, that works.

Steps:  


1.Add the desired password and username in the user login database via user_login_database.py file

2.you can check the login criteria by opening user_login.py

Further improvements: one may use CTK to make it look better and active to media queries, and link it to webbrowser or a website, such that this locally hosted login check loads a specific website.
